## PDF Deskewing (Auto Alignment)
> This module provides a fast and reliable way to detect and correct skewed pages in PDF files. It converts each page to an image, determines the skew angle, and deskews only the misaligned ones using OpenCV â€” preserving quality and improving OCR accuracy. Designed for internal use, with efficient multithreading and clean integration with pdf2image and deskew.
